Plot run-though
---------------

We're introduced to a young-looking Zuckerberg in a typically fast-paced
conversation with his (soon to be) ex-girlfriend. He is already presented as a
condesending, elitist, hoping gain a place in the "exclusive" soriety clubs.

After a hurried breakup, troubled Zuck seeks out for ideas for a comeback.
Blogging his way through his thought-process (using a "Live Journal"; perhaps an
old relic to remind us it's 1994; the techies getting a few other rapid-fire
nods in the form of a KDE desktop, an old IBM keyboard and the mention of
"Turing"), Zuck starts work on a website.
