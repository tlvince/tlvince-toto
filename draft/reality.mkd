04:30 in the morning. The verse of *girl* wakes me up. Appears to be coming from
my computer headphones. Computer is off. Drums in "Hey Jude" start playing. Pull
headphones out. Nothing. A flangey drum sound in the background. Checking room.
See a flash outside. Keep looking at computer. Roommate is there. Fire alarm
rang for 2 seconds at 04:45. Woke him up. Stopped and could hear a faint ring,
perhaps moving around in the halls. Hear a drum sound once more and people
talking outside.
