A tale of everyday frustrating user experience.

Developers are users too!

Fanboy
------

Here's the situation: I want to update Chromium's `userstyle` CSS file with the
latest Fanboy element hider rules. As hackers do, my first instinict is to write
a script to do it for me. A few lines of Python later, and I'm faced with this:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "C:\Python31\lib\urllib\request.py", line 1072, in do_open

        self.timeout)

        raise error(msg)
    socket.error: [Errno 10060] A connection attempt failed because the connected pa
    rty did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection f
    ailed because connected host has failed to respond

    During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "fanboy-update.py", line 30, in <module>
        main()

    because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or
    established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond>

"Uh?! It must be that damn corperate firewall again." Now, I've seen this one
before and, armed with another script (to set up `cmd` with the correct proxy
settings), I try again... with no joy:

    File "C:\Python31\lib\http\client.py", line 684, in _tunnel
    for header, value in self._tunnel_headers.iteritems():
    AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'iteritems'

"I'll fix it later", I think as I copy/paste the file manually.

YUI, You Eee?
-------------

"Hmm, I wonder if anyone's thought of minifying `userstyles`." With Fanboy's CSS
file, being ~4500 lines, it can't be a bad idea. Having not used `yuicompressor`
for a year or so now, I thought I'd take a look to see where the development has
come since then.

The YUI Compressor homepage looks like this:

"OK, well, where's the download link". That's a screenshot in a Chromium app
window and still there's another 2/3'rds to go. Scanning amongst the wall of
text, I finally notice the unassuming download link:

(res/dload)

Latest (presumedly stable) build was 2009?! Oh, well, I've come this far, I
might as well try it:

    java -jar yuicompressor-2.4.2.jar Custom.css

"Damnnn it!".

The battle has only just begun
------------------------------

The first result of a Google for `yui InvocationTargetException` returns a [bug
report][yuibug], with a comment mentioning a fix(?) was checkedin in 2010. "OK,
fine. It's impossible to not notice the "Fork me on GitHub" banner, so there
must be a newer build there."

"Damn, there are no pre-packaged builds. Nevermind, I'll try building myself."
Noticing the `build.xml` file, I head over to download Apache Ant. While, I've
never used `ant` before (I prefer `make`), I know it's a mature project, so
things should go smoothly, right?

Ant, err, Ivy
-------------

A quick Google for [apache ant][ivy] gives me those handy links to directly
jump to pages. "Hmm, what are those called again?" [google sitelinks][gsl].
"Great! relevant-looking results".

"This Help Centre is not currently available in your language." "Argh!!" Just
because I live in China, doesn't mean I can speak Chinese. Where's an English
fall-back option? Oh, forget it.

Anyway, those links are call "mini sitelinks". Back to the [apache ant][ivy]
search... I want to download it, and oh, great, there's the download link
straight away.

(res/...)

Nice, a nice easy download link.

(res/...)

    java -jar ivy-2.2.0.jar
    :: loading settings :: url = jar:file:/C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/43578759/My
    %20Documents/dwn/unsorted/apache-ivy-2.2.0-bin-with-deps/apache-ivy-2.2.0/ivy-2.
    2.0.jar!/org/apache/ivy/core/settings/ivysettings.xml
    :: resolving dependencies :: org.apache.ivy#ivy;2.2.0
            confs: [core, httpclient, oro, vfs, sftp, standalone, ant, default, test
    , source]

zzz. About a minute later and nothing happend. "Resolving dependencies... Oh,
it's trying to download something." Firing up the aformentioned "cmd proxy
setter" script, but no, still nothing.

Ant (round 2)
-------------

Something's up here. I'll rollback. Arbitrarily tried a [DDG search][ddg]
instead. Nice, an "offical site" badge. I wonder how the determine that. Hmm,
this is looking different...

(res/...)

Damn it! If this is `ant`, what did I just download? Pft, nevermind. Proceed to
the download link.

(res/...)

Good, nice and easy.

    ant
    Unable to locate tools.jar. Expected to find it in C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\li
    b\tools.jar
    Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
    Build failed

Huh?! "Build failed"? I just wanted to see if it'll run okay. And what's this
Java error? You didn't mention anything about Java.

    ant -h
    Unable to locate tools.jar. Expected to find it in C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\li
    b\tools.jar
    ant [options] [target [target2 [target3] ...]]
    Options:
      ...
      -buildfile <file>      use given buildfile
        -file    <file>              ''
        -f       <file>              ''
      ...

Hmm, seems like an option to specify the `build.xml` location (though, isn't
that what `[target]` is?). Anyway, let's try that:

    ant -buildfile "C:\Documents and Settings\43578759\My Doc
    uments\dwn\unsorted\yuicompressor-2.4.2\yuicompressor-2.4.2\build.xml"

    Perhaps JAVA_HOME does not point to the JDK.
    It is currently set to "C:\Program Files\Java\jre6"

**BUILD FAILED**. Ah, now you tell me that I explicitly need JDK.

JDK

OK (belegured by this point), let's grab that.

(res ...)

Damn. There's not much I can do about that.
