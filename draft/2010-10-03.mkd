Where good ideas come from
==========================

* Office should be like a coffee shop
* Breakthroughs come through communicating with others
    * The "Liquid Network"
* Hunch cultivation
    * Ideas develop over a long time
* Connecting ideas rather than protecting
* Open source
* Chance favours the connected mind

Comments
--------

* Filtering the noise
    * But still being immersed?
* No time is wasted unless you decide to waste it beforehand
