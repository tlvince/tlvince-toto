Thing's I will and won't miss about Hong Kong.

## Will

* Convenient transport (MTR, overnight buses)

## Won't

* Bad eating manors (slurping, squelching)
* Overcrowded transport
* Difficulties of having a balanced diet
    * Cheap, processed, take-away foods
    * Limited cooking facilities
    * Eating late (due to working culture)
